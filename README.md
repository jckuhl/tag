# How to Play

## Overview

Tag is a game for four players, each one starts in a corner.  One is picked as __it__ at random.  The objective of the game is to pick up the goodies that are scattered on the game and avoid __it__.  Whoever has the most goodies at the end, wins.

## Rules

This is a turn based game.  Each turn, a player rolls the dice to see how many spaces he can go.  The player must go that many spaces.  Along the way, the player can pick up any goodies or power ups in his path.  But the players must avoid __it__.

__it__ cannot pick up powers or goodies, it is imperative that __it__ chases other players so he can go back to collecting goodies.  If __it__ lands on the same tile as another player, that player is tagged and becomes the new __it__.  That player also loses a life.  If all three lives are exhausted, that player leaves the game, all remaining characters return to their starting points and __it__ is picked at random among the survivors.

When the game is down to two players, no one is __it__ and no new goodies will spawn.  The game ends when the last goodies are collected.

Goodies can be üç™ cookies, üç© donuts, üå≠ hot dogs, ü•ì bacon, or if you're feeling healthy, ü•¶ broccoli.



## Power Ups

- ‚ù§Ô∏è: Returns a health.  If __it__ or a player with full health encounters this, nothing happens
- üíé: Invincibility from __it__ for three turns.
- üí∞: Gives the catcher an extra 3 goodies. Ô∏è
- üöÄ: Teleports the player to a random spot on the field

# React Set Up:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can‚Äôt go back!**

If you aren‚Äôt satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you‚Äôre on your own.

You don‚Äôt have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn‚Äôt be useful if you couldn‚Äôt customize it when you are ready for it.
